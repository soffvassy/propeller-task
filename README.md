# React + TypeScript + tailwind + Vite

Project for Propeller;
Using pokeapi, load the OG pokemons with image and some info; sorting by search and type;
Pokemons can have either 1 or 2 types so that was handled, but you can only choose 1 to filter;
On hover on image it changes to the backside image <= done with tailwind 
and hosted on my website https://soffvassy.com/pokeapi

done with Vite if you run 

npm install 

and then 

npm run dev 

it should be up and running : )
